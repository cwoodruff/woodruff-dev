Have you ever needed to store **coordinates, track locations, or perform distance calculations** in your database? Whether you're building a **ride-sharing app, a location-based service, or an interactive map**, working with **spatial data** is essential.

Luckily, **EF Core supports spatial data types**, allowing you to **store, query, and manipulate geographic data seamlessly**. No more treating latitude and longitude as simple numbers—let’s bring real GIS (Geographic Information System) power to your EF Core apps!

* * *

## **What is Spatial Data?**

Spatial data represents **geographic locations** and features on the Earth's surface. Instead of dealing with raw latitude/longitude values, spatial data provides **rich functionality** for working with **points, lines, polygons, and even complex geometries**.

Think of it like this:  
**Points** – Represent single locations (e.g., a store location).  
**Lines** – Define paths or routes (e.g., roads, trails).  
**Polygons** – Represent areas (e.g., city boundaries, country borders).

Most modern databases, like **SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MySQL**, provide **native spatial data support**, allowing you to run **geospatial queries** efficiently.

* * *

## **Setting Up Spatial Data in EF Core**

Before we start playing with coordinates, we need to **set up EF Core to support spatial data**.

### **1\. Install the Required Packages**

If you're using **SQL Server**, you need the **NetTopologySuite** package, which enables spatial data support.

```bash
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer.NetTopologySuite
```

For **PostgreSQL**, install:

```bash
dotnet add package Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL.NetTopologySuite
```

### **2\. Configure DbContext to Use Spatial Support**

Modify your `DbContext` configuration to enable **NetTopologySuite**:

```csharp
public class AppDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Location> Locations { get; set; }

    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("Your_Connection_String", 
            x => x.UseNetTopologySuite()); // Enable spatial support
    }
}
```

This tells EF Core to **use spatial capabilities** when working with SQL Server (or PostgreSQL).

* * *

## **Defining Spatial Data in EF Core**

Now that **EF Core is ready**, let’s create an entity with a **geographic location**.

### **3\. Create an Entity with Spatial Data**

```csharp
using NetTopologySuite.Geometries;

public class Location
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public Point Coordinates { get; set; } // Stores latitude/longitude
}
```

**What’s happening here?**

- We **import `NetTopologySuite.Geometries`** to use spatial types.

- The **`Point` type** is used to store a **geographic location** (latitude & longitude).

* * *

## **Storing and Querying Spatial Data**

Now that we’ve defined our `Location` entity, let’s **add some data**!

### **4\. Inserting Spatial Data**

```csharp
using NetTopologySuite.Geometries;

var location = new Location
{
    Name = "Central Park",
    Coordinates = new Point(-73.9654, 40.7829) { SRID = 4326 } // Longitude, Latitude
};

context.Locations.Add(location);
await context.SaveChangesAsync();
```

**What is `SRID = 4326`?**

- [`SRID` (Spatial Reference Identifier)](https://spatialreference.org/) **defines the coordinate system**.

- `4326` is **[WGS 84](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System)**, the standard for latitude/longitude (used by GPS).

* * *

### **5\. Querying Nearby Locations**

Let’s say you want to **find locations within 5 kilometers of a user**:

```csharp
using NetTopologySuite.Geometries;
using NetTopologySuite.Geometries.Prepared;

var userLocation = new Point(-73.9851, 40.7580) { SRID = 4326 }; // Times Square

var nearbyLocations = await context.Locations
    .Where(l => l.Coordinates.IsWithinDistance(userLocation, 5000)) // 5km radius
    .ToListAsync();

foreach (var location in nearbyLocations)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Nearby: {location.Name}");
}
```

**How does this work?**

- **`IsWithinDistance()`** checks if a location is **within 5000 meters (5km)** of the user.

- This is **way more efficient** than manually filtering lat/lon values!

* * *

## **Working with Polygons: Defining Regions**

Let’s say you need to **store city boundaries** and check whether a location is inside a region.

### **6\. Create a Polygon Entity**

```csharp
public class CityBoundary
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string CityName { get; set; }
    public Polygon Area { get; set; } // Stores city boundary
}
```

### **7\. Query Locations Inside a City**

```csharp
var newYorkBoundary = context.CityBoundaries
    .FirstOrDefault(c => c.CityName == "New York");

var locationsInNYC = await context.Locations
    .Where(l => newYorkBoundary.Area.Contains(l.Coordinates))
    .ToListAsync();

foreach (var location in locationsInNYC)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{location.Name} is inside New York!");
}
```

**Why is this cool?**

- **`Contains()`** lets you check if a location is inside a polygon (city, park, etc.).

- This is **super useful for geofencing, city-based filtering, and spatial searches**.

* * *

## **When Should You Use Spatial Data in EF Core?**

**Location-Based Apps** – Track users, restaurants, stores, and landmarks.  
**Routing & Navigation** – Calculate distances, find nearby places, optimize paths.  
**Geofencing** – Detect when users enter or leave an area (e.g., delivery zones).  
**Real Estate & Mapping** – Store city boundaries, zip codes, and regions.

* * *

## **Wrap-Up: Bringing GIS Power to EF Core**

Spatial data in EF Core **isn’t just for maps—it’s for anything that involves locations, distances, and geographic relationships**. By using **NetTopologySuite** and EF Core’s spatial capabilities, you can:

**Store real-world locations with proper geospatial types**  
**Run optimized queries for nearby locations and distances**  
**Use polygons for geofencing, city boundaries, and more**

If you’re building anything with **location tracking, maps, or spatial analytics**, EF Core has the **built-in tools** to make it easy!
