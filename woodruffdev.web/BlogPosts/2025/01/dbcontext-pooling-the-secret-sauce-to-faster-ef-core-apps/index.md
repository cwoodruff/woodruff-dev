Imagine you’re running a restaurant. Every time a customer orders, you buy a brand-new frying pan, use it once, and toss it out. Sounds absurd, right? But that’s essentially what happens in EF Core when you create a new DbContext for every request. It’s wasteful, slow, and totally unnecessary. Enter **DbContext Pooling**: the genius way to reuse those frying pans—err, contexts—and turbocharge your app’s performance.

## **What Is DbContext Pooling?**

Think of DbContext Pooling as a VIP lounge for your DbContext instances. Instead of creating and disposing of a new DbContext for every request, EF Core prepares a pool of pre-configured DbContext objects. When a request comes in, it grabs one from the pool, uses it, and then returns it back like a good citizen.

This prevents your app from wasting precious resources by repeatedly creating and destroying objects. The result? You get significantly faster performance and fewer headaches.

## **How Does It Work?**

Here’s the magic in action:

1. **Without Pooling**
    - Every request spins up a shiny new DbContext. If your app gets thousands of requests, thousands of DbContext objects will be created and destroyed. Yikes!
    
    - _**Performance snapshot:**_
        - Total contexts created: 64,637
        
        - Requests per second: 6,395

3. **With Pooling**
    - By pooling, EF Core reuses the same DbContext instances whenever possible. Fewer object creations mean less garbage collection and better throughput.
    
    - _**Performance snapshot:**_
        - Total contexts created: 32
        
        - Requests per second: 15,714

That’s more than **double the throughput**!

## **How to Add DbContext Pooling to Your App**

Ready to join the pooling party? Here’s how you can set it up in just a few lines of code:

```csharp
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddDbContextPool<YourDbContext>(options =>
        options.UseSqlServer("YourConnectionString"));
}
```

That’s it! You’ve just unlocked a faster, more efficient app with minimal effort.

## **Things to Watch Out For**

Before you dive headfirst into pooling, here are a few things to keep in mind:

### **No Scoped Dependencies**

Your DbContext should be stateless, meaning it shouldn’t hold any references to services or objects with scoped lifetimes. Otherwise, you’ll run into bizarre bugs.

### **Reset Your State**

EF Core automatically resets the state of a pooled DbContext, but if you’re doing something fancy (like tracking lots of entities), make sure you don’t leave any messes behind.

### **Know Your Limits**

While pooling works wonders for most apps, it’s not a one-size-fits-all solution. Test your app’s performance and see if pooling delivers your needed boost.

## **Why You’ll Love DbContext Pooling**

DbContext Pooling is like upgrading your old bike to a sports car. It’s simple, efficient, and gives you more speed with less effort. Whether building blazing-fast APIs or high-throughput web apps, pooling ensures your EF Core app runs like a well-oiled machine.

So, what are you waiting for? Add DbContext Pooling to your app today and feel the performance boost. Trust me—your app (and your users) will thank you.
