Not everything in your database needs a **primary key**. Sometimes, you just want to query **views, stored procedures, or raw SQL results** without forcing a unique identifier on them. That’s where **Keyless Entity Types** in Entity Framework Core come in!

If you’ve ever struggled with querying **database views, reports, or read-only datasets**, this feature is **exactly what you need**. Let’s dive into what **Keyless Entity Types** are, when to use them, and how to make them work in EF Core.

* * *

## **What Are Keyless Entity Types?**

In EF Core, a **Keyless Entity Type** is an entity that **does not require a primary key**. Unlike standard EF Core entities that map to tables with primary keys, keyless entities are ideal for **queries that don’t need identity tracking**—such as reports, read-only views, or raw SQL queries.

### **Key Features of Keyless Entity Types:**

**No primary key required** – Useful for queries that don’t need a unique identifier.  
**Maps to database views, stored procedures, or raw SQL** – Ideal for reporting and read-only datasets.  
**Cannot be updated** – These entities are **read-only** in EF Core, preventing accidental modifications.

* * *

## **When Should You Use Keyless Entity Types?**

**Database Views** – If you have a **SQL view** that aggregates data across multiple tables, EF Core can query it **without requiring a primary key**.

**Stored Procedure Results** – If your app **executes a stored procedure** and expects complex results, Keyless Entity Types help map the output.

**Raw SQL Queries** – When you need **custom SQL results** that don’t neatly fit into a single table structure.

**Read-Only Reports** – If you’re generating reports that don’t modify data, Keyless Entity Types are **perfect for performance-friendly queries**.

## **How to Define a Keyless Entity Type in EF Core**

Let’s say you have a **database view** that provides a summary of order details, but it doesn’t have a primary key. Here’s how you’d map it in EF Core.

### **1\. Define the Keyless Entity**

```csharp
public class OrderSummary
{
    public int OrderId { get; set; }
    public string CustomerName { get; set; }
    public DateTime OrderDate { get; set; }
    public decimal TotalAmount { get; set; }
}
```

### **2\. Configure it in `DbContext`**

```csharp
public class AppDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<OrderSummary> OrderSummaries { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<OrderSummary>()
            .HasNoKey() // This makes it a Keyless Entity Type
            .ToView("View_OrderSummary"); // Maps it to the SQL view
    }
}
```

### **3\. Querying the Keyless Entity**

Since **Keyless Entity Types are read-only**, you can only **query them**, not insert, update, or delete.

```csharp
var summaries = await context.OrderSummaries.ToListAsync();

foreach (var summary in summaries)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Order {summary.OrderId} - {summary.CustomerName} - ${summary.TotalAmount}");
}
```

* * *

## **Using Keyless Entities with Raw SQL Queries**

Sometimes, you might need **custom SQL queries** instead of mapping to a database view. EF Core allows keyless entities to work with **raw SQL queries** using `FromSqlRaw()`.

### **1\. Define the Keyless Entity**

```csharp
public class ProductSales
{
    public string ProductName { get; set; }
    public int UnitsSold { get; set; }
}
```

### **2\. Configure It in `DbContext`**

```csharp
public class AppDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<ProductSales> ProductSalesReports { get; set; }

    protected override void OnModelCreating(ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    {
        modelBuilder.Entity<ProductSales>().HasNoKey();
    }
}
```

### **3\. Execute a Raw SQL Query**

```csharp
var salesReport = await context.ProductSalesReports
    .FromSqlRaw("SELECT ProductName, SUM(Quantity) AS UnitsSold FROM Sales GROUP BY ProductName")
    .ToListAsync();

foreach (var sales in salesReport)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{sales.ProductName}: {sales.UnitsSold} units sold");
}
```

**This lets you run custom SQL queries directly in EF Core while maintaining type safety!**

* * *

## **Things to Keep in Mind**

**Keyless Entity Types are Read-Only** – You **cannot** use them with `Add()`, `Update()`, or `Remove()`.

**No Change Tracking** – EF Core **doesn’t track keyless entities**, so you can’t modify them in-memory and expect EF Core to persist changes.

**Must Be Configured in `OnModelCreating()`** – Unlike regular entities, keyless types **must** be explicitly mapped in `OnModelCreating()`.

* * *

## **Wrap-Up: When You Need Data Without the Keys**

Keyless Entity Types are a **powerful feature** in EF Core that lets you **query data from views, stored procedures, and raw SQL queries** without worrying about primary keys. They’re **perfect for reporting, analytics, and read-only scenarios** where identity tracking isn’t needed.

So, next time you need to **query data that doesn’t fit neatly into an EF Core entity**, remember: **You don’t always need a key!**
