We’ve all been there—you’re halfway through a **multi-step transaction**, and **boom!** 💥 Something fails. You don’t want to roll back **everything**, just the part that went wrong.

That’s where **Transactional Savepoints** come in!

Savepoints let you **partially roll back** transactions, keeping the good stuff while undoing just the problematic parts. If you've ever wished for a _"Ctrl + Z"_ in database operations, this is it.

Let’s dive into what **savepoints** are, why they’re useful, and how to use them in **Entity Framework Core (EF Core)**!

* * *

## **Why Use Transactional Savepoints?**

By default, transactions in EF Core follow the **"all or nothing"** rule—either everything commits successfully, or the entire transaction gets rolled back. But sometimes, **you don’t want to lose everything** just because of a small issue.

**With savepoints, you can:**

- **Rollback specific parts** of a transaction instead of the whole thing.

- **Handle errors more gracefully** instead of restarting everything.

- **Improve performance** by avoiding full rollbacks and reprocessing.

- **Keep long-running transactions stable** by fixing issues in steps.

Imagine you're processing **a batch of payments**:

- 9 payments succeed

- 1 fails

- **With savepoints, you can roll back just the failed one and keep the rest!**

* * *

## **Step 1: Using Savepoints in EF Core Transactions**

Let’s say we have a **banking app** where users can transfer money between accounts. If one transfer fails, we don’t want to cancel all the transactions—just the one that failed.

### **1\. Start a Transaction**

```csharp
using var transaction = await context.Database.BeginTransactionAsync();

try
{
    await TransferMoney(1, 2, 500); // Transfer $500 from Account 1 to 2
    await context.Database.ExecuteSqlRawAsync("SAVEPOINT BeforeSecondTransfer");

    await TransferMoney(3, 4, 1000); // Transfer $1000 from Account 3 to 4
    await context.Database.ExecuteSqlRawAsync("SAVEPOINT BeforeThirdTransfer");

    await TransferMoney(5, 6, 2000); // Oops! This one might fail

    await transaction.CommitAsync(); // If everything is good, commit!
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
    await context.Database.ExecuteSqlRawAsync("ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT BeforeThirdTransfer"); // Roll back just the last one
}

```

**What’s happening here?**

1. **Start a transaction**

3. **Make some transfers**

5. **Create savepoints** before risky operations **(like large transfers)**

7. **Rollback only the problematic step** instead of **losing everything**

* * *

## **Step 2: Handling Savepoints in EF Core Using Transaction APIs**

If you prefer **EF Core’s built-in transaction API**, you can do this:

```csharp
using var transaction = await context.Database.BeginTransactionAsync();

try
{
    await TransferMoney(1, 2, 500);
    await transaction.CreateSavepointAsync("BeforeSecondTransfer");

    await TransferMoney(3, 4, 1000);
    await transaction.CreateSavepointAsync("BeforeThirdTransfer");

    await TransferMoney(5, 6, 2000); // This might fail

    await transaction.CommitAsync();
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Error: {ex.Message}");
    await transaction.RollbackToSavepointAsync("BeforeThirdTransfer"); // Undo only the last step
    await transaction.CommitAsync(); // Keep the rest!
}
```

**Now, you can rollback part of a transaction** without discarding everything!

* * *

## **When Should You Use Savepoints?**

### **1\. Batch Processing (Payments, Orders, Inventory Updates)**

If you’re processing **multiple orders/payments** in a single transaction, use savepoints to **rollback only failed ones** while keeping the rest.

### **2\. Long-Running Transactions**

Large transactions risk **locking database resources for too long**. Savepoints help **recover faster** without restarting the entire process.

### **3\. Handling Conditional Logic in Transactions**

If certain operations depend on previous ones, use **savepoints to undo bad steps** without breaking the rest.

### **4\. Preventing Partial Data Corruption**

If one step fails, but the rest are fine, **rolling back everything might be unnecessary**. Savepoints let you **recover selectively**.

* * *

## **Savepoints vs. Full Rollback: When to Use Each**

| Scenario | Savepoints | Full Rollback |
| --- | --- | --- |
| A single step fails in a multi-step transaction | **Yes** | No |
| A critical issue occurs, and everything must be undone | No | **Yes** |
| Some operations should be committed while others should not | **Yes** | No |
| The database state must return to the exact point before the transaction started | No | **Yes** |

**Savepoints are great when you want a "soft rollback" instead of a complete undo.**

* * *

## **Common Issues & How to Fix Them**

**Not All Databases Support Savepoints**

- SQL Server, PostgreSQL, and MySQL support them.

- SQLite does **not** support savepoints in the same way.

**Savepoints Must Be Created Inside Transactions**

- Always **begin a transaction first** before using savepoints.

**Avoid Too Many Savepoints**

- Each savepoint increases transaction overhead.

- Use them only for **critical operations that might fail**.

* * *

## **Wrap-Up: Smarter Rollbacks with Savepoints**

Transactional Savepoints in EF Core **let you undo only what you need**, keeping successful operations intact while recovering from failures. Instead of **rolling back everything**, savepoints let you:

- **Fix only the failing parts** of a transaction.

- **Keep successful operations intact.**

- **Improve performance** by avoiding full rollbacks.

Next time you’re dealing with **multi-step transactions**, consider **using savepoints to make them more reliable!**
